# Build Moira for ASE

Download the **Moira Motorola 68k emulator** from https://github.com/dirkwhoffmann/Moira/releases and place the files from the moira directory here. Do not overwrite the configuration file `MoiraConfig.h` or `CMakeLists.txt`.

In this directory, you will find the scripts to build the library depending on your system: `build.cmd` for Windows and `build.sh` for macOS/Linux.

To compile in a Windows environment, you will need `cmake.exe` in your system path or you can use the _Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt_.
